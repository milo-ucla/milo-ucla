### ðŸ”­ Current projects
I am currently working on an OS project based on the Raspberry Pi 2s architecture. Currently my goal is to create a Kernel / OS from scratch.

### ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning
In addition to learning more about C and C++ development, I am trying to imporove my frontend React skills by improving my personal website, as well as my data science skills working with Pandas.

I try to make everything I write open source. Some projects may rely on code that has specific licencing, so please consult the README and/or licence if you want to copy anything.
