## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Milo (he/him) and I am a 3rd year Computer Science major at UCLA! Some of my previous projects include UChat, a chat application designed for college students to collaborate, and Google Hangouts Analytics, a command-line tool to parse and analyze Google Takeout chat data. 

### ðŸ”¬ In progress 
I am currently working on an unreleased project using PyTesseract and CV2.

#### Finished Projects:
* MiniRogue - C++ dungeon crawler game
* Spotify Playlist Manager - scrapes a text file and updates your Spotify account accordingly. Perfect if you have a lot of music on a hard drive and want it all in your Spotify library.
* BobaBot - A Discord Bot that lets members keep track of how much boba they consume + gives fun Boba-fied inspirational quotes.
* UChat - A web chat room made using Node.js. Made for college students to collaborate, it supports image sharing and LaTeX input.


### ðŸŒ³ Iâ€™m currently learning . . .
I am learning more about C and C++ development, and I am also trying to imporove my JavaScript (Node.js / React) and Python experience.
