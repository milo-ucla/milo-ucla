## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Milo (he/him) and I am a 3rd year Computer Science major at UCLA! Some of my previous projects include UChat, a chat application designed for college students to collaborate, and Google Hangouts Analytics, a command-line tool to parse and analyze Google Takeout chat data. 

### ðŸ”¬ In progress 
I am currently working on an OS project based on the Raspberry Pi 3s architecture. Currently my goal is to create a Kernel / OS from scratch and learn more about ARM / OS design.

### ðŸŒ³ Iâ€™m currently learning . . .
In addition to learning more about C and C++ development, I am trying to imporove my back-end Node.js and frontend React skills by improving my personal website, as well as my data science skills working with Pandas.
