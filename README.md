## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Milo (he/him) and I am a 3rd year Computer Science major at UCLA! Some of my previous projects include UChat, a chat application designed for college students to collaborate, and Google Hangouts Analytics, a command-line tool to parse and analyze Google Takeout chat data. 

### ðŸŒ³ Iâ€™m currently learning . . .
I am learning more about C and C++ development, and I am also trying to imporove my JavaScript (Node.js / React) and Python skills.
