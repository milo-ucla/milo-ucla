## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Milo (he/him) and I am a 4th year Computer Science major at UCLA! Some of my previous projects include UChat, a chat application designed for college students to collaborate; Google Hangouts Analytics, a command-line tool to parse and analyze Google Takeout chat data; Spotify MusicOrganizer, a script that imports music from your local media files into a Spotify library; and RogueLite, an ASCII dungeon crawler game where you fight monsters and collect treasure!

### ðŸŒ³ Iâ€™m currently learning . . .
I am learning more about C and C++ development, and I am also trying to imporove my JavaScript and Python skills.
